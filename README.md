## 📖 Overview
This project — developed using **nRF24L01** modules and **ESP32** boards — gathers documentation and safe experiments for learning about Bluetooth/BLE and RF signaling in a legal, ethical way. The emphasis is on passive monitoring, not packet analysis, rather on protocol learning, and building controlled lab exercises for students and researchers.

Goals:
- Understand BLE and RF packet structures and behaviors.
- Perform **passive** captures and logging using ESP32 and nRF24L01 hardware in permitted environments.
- Create reproducible lab exercises to teach secure pairing, privacy addresses, and interference mitigation.
- Provide safe, legal guidance for setting up an isolated test environment.

> ⚠️ This repository will never provide instructions to build or operate jammers or active interference devices.

### 📈 Measurement Overview — BLE & Bluetooth

The spectrum analyzer tests documented below capture the emissions produced by the device in the **2.4 GHz ISM band (2.400 – 2.4835 GHz)**.  
During each test mode, the device performed a **frequency sweep across BLE and Bluetooth channels** to evaluate spectral behavior and signal distortions.

- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**: 40 channels, **2 MHz spacing**, from **2402 MHz to 2480 MHz**.  
- **Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR)**: 79 channels, **1 MHz spacing**, from **2402 MHz to 2480 MHz**.

> ⚠️ Note: The device operation is shown for academic and educational purposes only. No instructions or parameters are provided to operate or reproduce emissions. All tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment with proper authorization.

### 📈 Measurement Results (Summary)

- **Instrument:** Anritsu MS2760A-0070 spectrum analyzer.  
- **Captured data:** spectrum analyzer traces highlighting distortion in BLE/Bluetooth bands during device operation.  
- **Observed effects:** spectral broadening, spurious components and harmonics consistent with strong in-band emissions. These effects were recorded for documentation and analysis purposes only.  
- **Test modes:** the device was evaluated under several modes; during each mode the device performed sweeps across channels to observe frequency-dependent behavior. *(Operational parameters and control signals are intentionally omitted from this repository.)*  
- **Purpose:** these measurements inform detection/mitigation strategies and support responsible research into electromagnetic compatibility and spectrum monitoring.

> ⚠️ Note: Raw operation logs or parameter sets that would enable reproduction of emissions are excluded from this repository.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Guidelines
- Do not capture or analyze traffic from third-party devices without explicit permission.  
- Passive monitoring may still be subject to local laws — check your national telecom regulations.  
- Keep careful logs of tests, dates, and authorizations.  
- Perform any active tests only inside a shielded enclosure and with written consent.
